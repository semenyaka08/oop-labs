# OOP Labs

This repository contains a collection of individual laboratory works on object-oriented programming (OOP) using C# and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). Each folder represents a separate lab project with different tasks, solutions, and features implemented in WPF.

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to completing various object-oriented programming labs using C# and WPF. Each lab focuses on different aspects of OOP principles, such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation, with practical implementations in WPF applications.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**: For implementing object-oriented programming principles.
- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI) of the applications.
- **.NET Core**: The framework used for the development of these labs.
- **Rider**: The IDE used for writing, testing, and debugging the code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these projects locally, you need to have the following installed:

1. **.NET SDK**: Download and install the latest .NET SDK.
2. **JetBrains Rider** or **Visual Studio**: You can use any of these IDEs to open and work with the solution files.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/semenyaka08/oop-labs.git
   ```
2. Open the `Lab6` solution in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution to restore dependencies.
4. Run the desired project:
   - Start `Lab6` to test the integration of Object2 and Object3.
   - Alternatively, you can run `Object2` or `Object3` independently for isolated functionality testing.
